# Arithmetic Arranger Projects
## Introduction
This is my solution for freeCodeCamp's Python for Scientific Computing project. The code solution is in the ``arithmetic_arranger.py`` file, whilst the ``main.py`` is the code for interactive interface to run this program. Hence, for the rules and expected results of the projects, please checkout the [freeCodeCamp project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/arithmetic-formatter).
The ``main.py`` is CLI-based interactive program where user can select menu and submit the desired arithmetic problems.

## How to
Clone this repo and run the ``main.py`` with python:
```
python main.py
```
